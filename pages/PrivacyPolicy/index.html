        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            We offer a wide range of services that focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling,
            financing, and home improvement. We know that everyone’s home journey is different, and that deciding on the
            right place to call home is an intimate, personal experience. Along with a wealth of information about
            homes, neighborhoods, market conditions, local real estate professionals, and financing options, we also use
            the information you give us to provide our services and help you find your next home. We carefully evaluate
            how we use data to make sure that we’re using your information to provide value for you. On this page, we
            aim to explain everything you need to know about your privacy at Zillow. If you have any questions that we
            haven’t answered here, you can always contact us at privacy@zillow.com
        </p>

        <h2>Information collected by Zillow</h2>

        <p>
            When you use our services, we collect a variety of information from and about you and your devices. Some of
            this information identifies you directly (like an email address) while some of it is associated with you
            through your account, profile, or device (like the homes you choose to save or your location data).
            The kind of data we collect about you depends on how you use Zillow. If you only use our services to browse
            for homes, we’ll have less information about you than if we help you sell your home, get a mortgage, sign
            your lease, or if you use any of our other transaction services. Even if you don’t have an account with us,
            we may still collect some data about you, like your email address and phone number if you choose to contact
            a real estate agent through our platform, or your IP address and other device information when you browse
            our sites or use our apps.
        </p>
        <h2>Information you give us or create using our services</h2>
        <p>
            When you use our services, we often ask you for information about yourself. This usually includes basic
            things like your name, email address, and phone number. If you use our transaction services, we might ask
            you for more sensitive data like your income, housing history, and credit score. If you contribute
            information, such as agent reviews, we’ll store that as well.

            You may also provide information about other people through our services. For example, if you share a home
            listing with someone, we will collect that person’s email address as part of your account information.

            Below are some examples of what information we collect for our main products and services and how we collect
            it.
